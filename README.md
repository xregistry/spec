[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7295/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7295)

The xRegistry project (short for "extensible registry") defines an abstract
model for how to manage metadata about resources and provides a REST-based
interface for creating, modifying, deleting and discovering of those resources.
The project includes a "core" specification that defines the basic model and
APIs of a Registry and a set of domain-specific specifications that extend that
core for particular use cases. By leveraging the same "core" model/APIs,
generic tooling and common patterns of Registry access can be developed which
help create an interoperable (and standard) interface.

It is expected that further specifications will be developed, both as part
of the xRegistry project and outside, that will leverage this framework for
additional purposes.

xRegistry was first developed under the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io)
project, and in April 2023 it was split into its own project but continues
to share many organizational resources with the CloudEvents and CNCF Serverless
Working Group (such as the weekly meetings).

The name `xRegistry` (standing for extensible registry) is meant to be written
with a lowercase `x`, even when the first word in a sentence.

If you are new to the family of xRegistry specifications, it is recommended
that you start by reading the [xRegistry Primer](core/primer.md) for an
overview of the specification's goals and design decisions, and then move on
to the [core specification](core/spec.md).

This specification is being developed by the
[CNCF Serverless Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless). This
working group meets every Thursday at 9AM PT (USA Pacific)
([World Time Zone Converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9:00%20am&tz=San%20Francisco&)):

for the latest information on how to join the calls.

The working group also meets
* every Tuesday & Wednesday at 9AM ET (USA Eastern Time)
* and every Friday at 8:30AM ET (USA Eastern Time)

to develop xRegistry specifically. For those meetings, please see the
[xRegistry Meeting Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YtBnjAyNdMLhAFYiq4yTrHcWpFjW-FWcV9neCTL6XRs/edit?usp=sharing).
