# xRegistry Primer

<!-- no verify-specs -->

## Abstract

This non-normative document provides an overview of the [xRegistry
specification](https://github.com/xregistry/spec/blob/main/core/spec.md). It is
meant to complement the xRegistry specification to provide additional background
and insight into the history and design decisions made during the development of
the specification. This allows the specification itself to focus on the
normative technical details.

## History

The CNCF Serverless Working group was originally created by the CNCF's Technical
Oversight Committee to investigate Serverless Technology and to recommend some
possible next steps for some CNCF related activities in this space. After
creating [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents) as a foundation for an
interoperable ecosystem for event-driven applications the next step was to
create a metadata model for declaring CloudEvents, their payloads and
associating those declarations with application endpoints. As a result, the
xRegistry (extensible registry) specification was created.

xRegistry was initially part of CloudEvents, called "CloudEvents Discovery" but
later moved into its own repository.

## Value proposition

xRegistry provides a specification to define metadata and extensions for
resources in an abstract model that can be used to centralize and standardize
information about resources in a system. The core specification defines the
basic building blocks for managing metadata about resources and provides
multiple formats to [represent](#representations) this information.

xRegistry can be used to represent any type of metadata, as long as it adheres
to the basic model in which a registry consists of groups, which in turn
consists of multiple resources which can have multiple versions defined. This
model is useful for any metadata that is crucial to the operation of a system or
helps facilitate the interaction between systems. The use cases for xRegistry
are therefore very broad. See
[possible use cases](#possible-use-cases) for more examples.

In addition to the core specification, xRegistry provides secondary
specifications for [endpoints](../endpoint/spec.md),
[schemas](../schema/spec.md), and [messages](../message/spec.md), that further
build upon the core to provide more domain-specific standardization in the
context of event-driven systems. The following subsections provide a more
specific overview of how xRegistry can be used to address common challenges in
the event-driven space.

### Why build something new?

There are numerous metadata registries available today. Several schema
registries exist. There are standards for container image registries, package
registries, and API registries. When this effort was started, there was no
registry for the particular use case of managing metadata about events and their
endpoints. The CloudEvents project had already defined a schema registry API to
complement the `dataschema` attribute of CloudEvents, which the team sought to
extend.

As the project evolved, it became clear that the specification needed to be more
generic to accommodate a wider range of use cases, which is why the xRegistry
specification was created. The result is a symmetric API and document format
that can be used to manage and discover the full metadata graph of a system,
given models that declare the respective resource types.

Existing registry standards like OCI, Maven, or NPM can indeed be projected into
the xRegistry resource model shape, allowing for a consistent way to manage
metadata about these resources and, most importantly, to enable
cross-referencing between these diverse resources. A container image contains an
application made available as a package that exposes an endpoint that can accept
events whose payloads have particular schemas. The xRegistry model allows all
these resources and their relationships to be expressed in a single model, and
it can yet leave the authoritative management of the individual resources to
the respective registries as those can be proxied with an xRegistry API or
import/exported into an xRegistry representation.

### Discovery

One of the pain points of event-driven systems is the need to create and
maintain documentation about endpoints and the events they expose, enabling
consumers from other teams or even other organizations to have all relevant
information required to implement their use cases successfully. By relying on a
centralized registry, individual teams who want to discover, query, produce and
consume events from endpoints have a single point of truth to refer to. In
addition, xRegistry allows specifying extensions and metadata that can further
describe events on more detailed levels. As an example, it is possible to define
an event, and mark specific metadata that are required. Due to its rich metadata
model, metadata can also be expressed in human language, making it easier for
developers, data-analysts, or even business analysts to understand.

### Vendor-agnostic

xRegistry provides a specification to define, query, group, version and enforce
schemas for systems. Multiple schema registry solutions exist already,
including [Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html), [Azure Event Hubs Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/schema-registry-overview)
or [Apicurio Registry](https://www.apicur.io/registry/), [AWS Glue Schema Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/schema-registry.html)
and more.

These schema registries are broker- and therefore vendor-specific and even
protocol-specific, which causes friction when an event travels through multiple
brokers. In such cases, clients have to deal with the implementation differences
across registries, for example when validating event structures, hindering
interoperability and, therefore, complicating integration scenarios. xRegistry
aims to address this with an agnostic specification, providing a common base
across these offerings.

### Versioning

As systems evolve, the endpoints that emit events may change, as may the events
themselves. Changes can sometimes break consumers making compatibility
strategies essential to indicate to consumers how they may expect events or
endpoints to evolve. xRegistry allows indicating a registry’s compatibility
strategy which is enforced when making changes to the registry, avoiding
mistakes. The specifications further also enables marking endpoints as
deprecated, possibly providing an alternative endpoint, making these easier to
discover for consumers. Finally, event schemas are also version aware, storing
multiple versions of an event’s data schema.

### Schema validation

The registry contains granular definitions for events defining their schemas,
which serve as a contract between publishers and consumers. This doesn’t only
apply to the message payload, but also to the message metadata, allowing
granular control of required fields on the metadata level. The registry does not
only serve as a definition of the required schemas, but can also be used to
enforce it. A registry service could use the registry to perform validation
on-publish, rejecting any events that don’t adhere to the schema for that
context, avoiding the problem of poison messages.

### Payload reduction

Schema information enables real-time analysis of incoming data based on its
contextual meaning, which is why applications often use serialization mechanisms
which include schema information (such as JSON) in payloads. Having a
centralized registry, enables applications to rely on lighter weight
serialization formats, significantly reducing bandwidth, while still allowing
accurate real-time analysis of incoming data using the registry.

### Schema-based data contract generation

xRegistry provides a specification to manage metadata in files which can be
stored next to the corresponding source code. This enables storing versions of
the model with their corresponding code in source control. This greatly
simplifies accurate recreation of the state of the system or environment, as all
schema-information is stored side-by-side with the code, avoiding issues in
reconciling the version of the code with the version of the schema.

Alternatively, metadata can also be managed in a Registry service, assuming it
adheres to the xRegistry API specification. The Registry service acts as a
central component that can be queried by any service that needs to interact with
the metadata.

This enables teams to use code generation to generate relevant data contracts
when interacting with endpoints. This removes the need for shared code packages
and avoids any bugs on the data contract level.

### Producer and consumer generation

Further, building upon the idea of schema-based data contract generation, even
client-code can be generated. When the schema is defined in a vendor-agnostic,
well-defined format, tooling can be built upon this foundation to generate
broker-specific consumers that can consume events from endpoints defined in the
registry. This is not only limited to event consumers, but may also include
generation of event store inserts. This can further speed up and streamline the
development of both producers and consumers, significantly reducing development
and testing time and minimizing the risk of introducing bugs at this level.
Clemens Vasters built a proof-of-concept that shows this approach in
the [Avrotize VS Code Extension](https://github.com/clemensv/avrotize).

### Basis for further developments

CloudEvents serve as a mechanism to aid in the delivery of events from a
producer to a consumer, which is applicable independently of the protocol (MQTT,
HTTP, Kafka, and AMQP) or encoding (JSON, XML, SOAP, Avro, etc.). xRegistry
further builds upon this by providing a specification to define resources that
correlate specific events to endpoints, providing versioning information and
more extensive metadata.

The xRegistry specification serves as a strong foundation to further build upon
in subsequent versions and/or outside of xRegistry, by correlating events and
endpoints system-wide. This will eventually lead to the definition of event
flows, making these discoverable and predictable, as opposed to relying on
human-produced documentation or observability on emerging behavior to understand
complex flows.

## Motivation

While CloudEvents are harmonizing different event structures across event
providers and increase interoperability between different brokers and their
protocols, they do not address:

- **Discovery:** Where to produce/consume events? What endpoints exist?
- **Validation:** How to validate event structures?
- **Versioning:** How to version metadata describing events – and see which
  versions exist?
- **Serialization:** How are events serialized? How do their envelope (if any)
  and formats (XML / JSON Schema) look like?
- **Extension Discovery:** How to identify which events using which specific
  extensions?

Schema registries can provide an answer to these questions, but just like event
brokers, there are multiple registries, such as the Confluent Schema Registry,
the Azure Event Hubs Registry or the Apicurio Registry. When an event travels
through multiple brokers, its schema has to be introduced to the broker's
registry and clients later have to deal with the implementation differences
between different registries, for example when trying to validate an event
structure. This hinders the interoperability of event brokers CloudEvents had in
mind. xRegistry therefore comes in with a similar motivation to CloudEvents:
Harmonize another piece of technology in the messaging / eventing ecosystem to
increase interoperability and decouple event handling from broker products and
protocols.

Even though xRegistry was built with eventing in mind, the concept of this
registry specification is far more powerful and can be used for the exchange for
any type of message. Take a look at the [Possible Use
Cases](#possible-use-cases) for examples outside the eventing world.

## Design Goals

- **Interoperability:** Enable effortless discovery, validation and versioning
  of resources.
- **Standardization:** Establish a high level structure for managing resource
  metadata behind which vendors can unite.
- **Extensibility:** Accommodate future innovations by allowing for the
  definition of custom attributes and extensions tailored to specific needs
  – not only for the happy path, but errors as well.
- **Flexibility:** Support various resource types, protocols (MQTT, AMQP, Kafka,
  NATS, HTTP..) and schema languages (JSON Schema, Avro Schema, Protobuf..)
  – not just CloudEvents.
- **Simplicity:** Allow simple use cases that do not need versioning of
  resources or a full-blown schema registry on the server.

### Non-Goals

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Rely on established security standards
  depending on the registry representation.
- **Relationships between event channels:** Focus on precisely describing a
  single event channel before standardizing the relationships between event
  channels.

## Representations

An xRegistry can be represented in the different ways: a JSON file, a static
file server and an API server. When building up this spec the API server had the
highest priority, followed by the file representation and the static file server
as an option to transition between the first two. To enable this transition, one
of the design goals is the symmetry between all representations.

Whenever registries get large, you will realistically want to use the API server
or CLI to create the registry and then use its export function to generate files
for the file or static file server representation.

### File

The registry is represented as a single JSON file.

The primary use case for this representation is a registry whose purpose is to
be used in cases where file-based access is preferred over network-based access.
This could be a project on your local machine or a public git repository, where
the registry basically becomes a declaration manifest of the application(s). If
you are new to xRegistry and are just trying to get the idea of the project,
this is a great point to start.

Writing up a registry by hand can be a great way of getting the idea, but it can
get tedious quickly. This is when you want to use the API server.

### Static File Server

The registry is represented by multiple JSON files, where each one represents a
single entity within the registry, served via a static file server (e.g. S3 or
similar) that follows the folder and file structure of the API server.

The primary use case for this representation is the transition between File and
API Server representation. To allow for sharing of individual entities of the
registry rather than the entire registry as a single JSON document, splitting up
your single JSON file into multiple ones and structuring them in different
folders can keep things easy.

Another benefit of this representation is that you only have to rent storage,
but no compute units. You could spin up an xRegistry using GitHub Pages, just
like a Helm registry. You save money and don't have to worry about maintaining a
compute unit.

Since the static file server is read-only, adding resources to the registry is
only possible by rebuilding the server and file structure, e.g. via pipelines.
If you want to directly write to the server or need sophisticated searching and
filtering, you might consider using the API server instead. Adding server logic
to the static file server to make up for the features of the API server is
considered an anti pattern.

### API Server

The API server is the most sophisticated representation of xRegistry. When you
have multiple teams that are using the same registry with distributed ownership
of the managed resources, therefore differentiated authorization – then the API
server is your way to go. This could apply to large organizations, enterprises
etc.

The primary use case of the API server is sharing resources with multiple
end-users and allowing direct write access to the server. You won't have to
generate files and split them up in directories like in the static file server
and can make use of the server-side logic like searching, filtering and export
options.

Running the API server requires you to set up a compute unit and a persistence
layer and maintain both. In exchange you get all the benefits listed above.
While starting with the API server might be a little more work upfront, it saves
you from migrating representations as your registry grows.

## Possible Use Cases

### CloudEvents

Since xRegistry emerged from the CloudEvents project and initially was called
"CloudEvents Discovery" the obvious use case is to manage all the CloudEvents of
your event-driven architecture inside xRegistry. The spec supports "CloudEvents"
as a format and allows you to define further restrictions on how your
CloudEvents look, what extensions they use or which fields are required for your
specific use-case even though the original spec marks them as optional. In
addition, the `dataschema` attribute of a CloudEvent can then point to a
xRegistry schema document making this two projects that work hand in hand.

### Business objects

When defining the schemas of business objects in an enterprise, xRegistry can be
the schema store for these definitions. One can then reference them in a data
catalogue as well as in OpenAPI and AsyncAPI documents without repeating the
schemas for the actual business objects.

### Metadata files in repositories

Open source repositories could provide an xRegistry represented as a simple JSON
file on the top level of the folder structure and list all metadata files this
repository contains like a `package.json`. This would allow machine-readable
access to project dependencies and configurations as well as consistent
management of metadata across different tools and environments.

## Design decisions or topics of interest

### Resource.ID vs Resource.Version.ID

Resources, like all xRegistry entities, have unique `id` values. Resource
`id`s are often user-friendly values that often have an implied semantic
meaning of the purpose of the underlying Resource document. Also, since they
are static values and as the Resource changes over time (meaning, new Versions
are created), it's important for end-users to have a static URL reference to
the default Version of the Resource.

Versions of a Resource, on the other hand, might change quite often and the
`id` isn't meant to convey the purpose of the underlying entity, rather it is
meant to uniquely specify its "version number". As such, the semantics
meaning and usage of the two `id` values are quite different. This means that
there might be times when they are the same value. However, while this is
allowable, it has no influence on any specification defined semantics of the
xRegistry model. As a result, implementations might want to avoid using `id`
values that could appear on a Resource and one of its Versions simply to avoid
potential confusion for their end-users.

### Valid Characters

The xRegistry specification restricts the allowable characters for attribute
and map key names. While it can be considered overly restrictive, for example
uppercase characters are not permitted, this was done because considerations
had to be made to take into account where these names might appear.

Some of the challenges:

- attribute and key name might appear as HTTP headers, which are
  case-insensitive. On the surface this would mean that simply not allowing
  more than one name of different cases would suffice. However, in the case
  of the name being part of a open-ended extension (e.g. allowable due to a
  `*` defined attribute), the server has no way of knowing its proper case.
  And when they're serialized in the HTTP body, case then matters.
- some network proxying software limit the allowable characters that can
  appear in HTTP header names by default. For example, nginx will drop all
  HTTP headers that include underscore (`_`) characters. While there are most
  likely configuration flags to disable this behavior, it might not always
  be possible (or easy) for xRegistry implementations to modify those
  networking components.
- often attribute names, or object property names, are mapped into code
  variable or properties within code structures. While many programming
  languages allow for a mapping from those names to their serialization
  names, often these mapping can introduce pain - either because they require
  additional work/configuration or simply due to errors being introduced
  by not using the language specific default mapping.

So rather than raising the bar for installation, maintenance, and debugging
(detecting the possible issues mentioned above), it was deemed better to
simply avoid the problem (and hopefully increase interoperability) by just
limiting the allowable characters.

Note though, map key names allow more characters than well-define object
attribute names because map key names are not usually mapped to well-defined
variable or structure property names - they're usually just stored as
"strings" a map data structure.

### Extensions

- it's RECOMMENDED that all extensions be defined in advance as part of the
  model. However, the spec does support an extension of "\*" to allow for
  unknown/runtime-provided extensions. Since extensions can appear in case-
  insensitive situations (e.g. http header) we can't know the case of them
  when storing in the backend. As a result, all attributes and key names MUST
  be lowercase.

- "default" Resource is just a pointer, NOT a set of default values
- we allow for implicit creation of a resource's tree rather than requiring
  multiple create operations - just for convenience
- if/when we support serializing in non-json formats, we'll need to define
  the serialization rules. E.g. when attributes appear as xml attributes vs
  nested elements
- when hasdocument=false, we might need to talk about when ?meta appears on the
  various URLs (self, defaultversionurl, location,...). Right now its presence
  will match what was used in the request (either explicitly or implicity).
  So GET resource?meta or GET group?inline both ask for metadata
- xRegistry- headers: first "-" separates xRegistry from attribute name,
  next "-" separates attribute name from key, any subsequent "-" is part
  of the key name. E.g. xRegistry-labels-abc-def:xxx => labels["abc-def"]=xxx
- impact of "\*required" flags at multiple levels
- why we don't use underscore in our property names, tho legal to do so
  - not all http proxies (e.g. nginx) pass them along by default
  - so, while spec allows underscores, use at your own risk
- discuss any potential semantic gotchas when one attribute is required
  but a nested attribute is optional, or also required (and visa-versa)
  - reminder: clientrequired=true means serverrequired=true as well, else error
- how MIGHT someone implement multi-tenancy with xRegistry
  - and layers of xRegistries to get multi-level grouping ??

### Deleting entities

The "delete" operation typically has two variants:

- `DELETE .../<ID>[?setdefaultversionid=VID]`
- `DELETE .../<COLLECTION>[?setdefaultversionid=VID]`

where the first will delete a single entity, and the second can be used to
delete multiple entities. In the second case there are a couple of design
points worth noting:

- if the HTTP body is empty, then the entire collection will be deleted.
  If the collection is `versions`, then the owning Resource must also be
  deleted since a Resource must always have at least one Version
- if the HTTP contain an array, then an empty (zero item) array is valid,
  but it will have no change on the server since there are not items listed
  to be deleted
- if the array is not empty and one of the items in there is already deleted,
  or never existed at all, then rather than generating an error (e.g. a `404`),
  the server will ignore this condition and continue processing the list.
  This is because the net result will be what the user is asking for.
  Note, that this is different from `DELETE ../<ID>` case where if the
  referenced entity can not be found then a `404` must be generated.
- when the `?setdefaultversionid` query parameter is specified (when
  deleting Version) then it will be applied after all requested items have
  been deleted successfully. It can be used even if the current "default"
  Version isn't being deleted. Note that a `404` in the `DELETE .../<ID>` case
  is an error and no changes to the "default" Version will occur.

### Detection of Referenced Resources

The xRegistry specification allows for Resources to appear in multiple Groups
via use of the `xref` feature. This could lead to situations where a user
deletes a Resource without knowing that other Resources reference it -
resulting in "dangling pointers". The specification does not define any
mechanism by which a user can determine if a Resource is the target of an
`xref`, or how many other Resources might reference it, in order to avoid
this situation. However, implementations may choose to take some action to
help users if they wish. For example, provide some kind of "warning" of the
impending "dangling pointer" state prior to doing the delete, or providing
some kind of "xref counter" extension on the target Resource. The specification
might consider adding some feature to address this in the future, but as of now
it is left as an implementation choice.

### Shared/Referenced Resources

As discussed above, Resource may appear in multiple Groups via use of the
`xref` feature. Users of the Registry may wish to consider how best to manage
these "shared" Resources within their associated Groups. For example, if a
Resource might be removed from any of the Groups it is a member of, then it
might be best to create a dedicated "shared resources" type of Group so that
it can have a lifecycle that is independent of its association of any other
Group. Similarly, choosing an initial Group for the Resource could be a
critical decision as it can not be changed later on, and that Group ID will
be part of the Resource's unique identifier forever.

Additionally, how the implementation of the xRegistry manages
access-control-rights of Resources (often via Groups) might influence the
initial placement into a Group of a new Resource.

# Default Version and Maximum Versions

Each Resource type can specify the maximum number of Versions that the
server must save. Once that limit is reached then it must delete Versions
to stay within the limit - by deleting oldest Versions first. However, since
tagging a Version as "default" marks that Version as special, this pruning
logic must skip the "default" Version. There is one exception to this rule.
If the maximum Versions is set to 1 then when a new Version is created, that
Version will become the "default" Version regardless of whether or not the
user asked for it to be.

In general, during an operation that creates, updates or deletes the Versions
of a Resource, the following logic is applied:

- Modify the Versions collection as requested
- Apply the "default" processing logic by setting (or not) which Version is the
  "default"
- If the number of Versions exceeds the maximum allowed Versions then, starting
  with the oldest, keep deleting until the collection is within the limit.
  Except if the limit is 1, in which case if a new Version is created then it
  it tagged as "default"

Let's walk through a complex example:

- Max allowed Versions is 2
- Initially the following Versions exist: v4, v2 (default)
- Max allowed Versions is now set to 0 (meaning unlimited)
- New Versions are created in this order: v5 (default=true), v6, v7
- The resulting Versions are (newest to oldest): v7, v6, v5 (default), v4, v2
- The maximum allowed Version is now set to 1, this will cause pruning
- The result is: v5. Note that it is not v7 because v5 was tagged as "default"
- A new Version (v8) is created
- The result is: v8 regardless of whether v8 was created with isdefault=true or
  not

# Potential Extensions

- `createdby`, `modifiedby`<br>
  These are related to the `createdat` and `modifiedat` attributes in that
  they would normally be updated at the same time as their corresponding
  `*at` attribute, and are use to track the identity of the person or
  component that performed the related operation.

  The xRegistry specification does not define these since it does not define
  any authentication mechanisms, or even manage tracking of these identities.
  However, if an implementation does track this information, these attributes
  might be of interest.

# Why Epoch?

Why such an unusual name? As the specification describes, `epoch` is used as a
way to help detect when an entity has been modified. It is very similar to
HTTP's [ETag](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-etag)
header.

When choosing a name for this attribute the most obvious choices revolved
the word `version`. However, the potential overlapping naming and differing
semantics conflicts with the Version entity of the model could lead to
confusion. We decided to use `epoch` because "epoch" is about "time",
which is indirectly related to what this attribute is meant to convey: has
this entity's history changed?

Additionally, the word is unique enough that the chances of people assuming
they know what it means due to some other usage in this technology space
seemed unlikely. In fact, use of this word might pique people's curiosity
and cause them to look it up in the specification to find out more about it.

# Naming and Case Sensitivity

The following explains some of the reasoning behind the casing and case
sensitivity rules in the specification.

- Attributes must be lower case.
  Attributes, include extensions attributes, can appear in many different
  locations. When serialized as part of the xRegistry metadata for an entity,
  they would appear in a JSON object as an attribute name and in those cases
  the case of the name matters. However, that same name might also appear in
  an HTTP header name - where its case is not relevant, and can be freely
  changed by middleware.

  Since it is possible for unknown attributes to appear in case insensitive
  locations, it would then be impossible for implementations of the
  specification to know what the true/intended case of the attribute name
  should be. To avoid mismatches, confusion and interoperability issues, the
  specification requires all attribute names to be in lower case. This avoids
  complicated logic to guess as to the proper case of these names.

- Groups and Resources must be lower case.
  The plural version of the Group and Resource type names can appear in URLs
  (which is case-sensitive). Additionally, the plural variant can also appear
  in attribute names (e.g. `<COLLECTION>*` attributes), and as discussed above,
  attributes must be lower case.

  The singular version of the Group and Resource type names, can also appear
  in the `<RESOURCE>*` attributes, which (again) means they must be lower case.

  For these reasons, both the plural and singular names of Group and Resource
  types must be defined as lower case.

- IDs are case-sensitive and case-insensitive.
  Entity identifiers (`id`s), never appear as attribute or HTTP header
  names. Meaning, they never appear in case-insensitive locations, so they
  do not have the same constraints that attributes, Groups or Resources do.
  For this reason, IDs are not restricted to using just lower case letters.
  This then also means that when there is a "look-up" done by an ID, it must
  be done in a case-sensitive way.

  However, there is another aspect of IDs that needs to be taken into account:
  the human factor. Despite them being case-sensitive, if the specification
  allowed for two entities at the same location in the data model to exist
  where they had the same IDs except for their case, it could make things very
  error-prone for users and leave them with a bad user experience.

  For this reason, while the processing of IDs is treated as case-sensitive
  values, the specification requires that IDs must be case-insensitive unique
  within the scope of its parent entity.

  While it may have been more consistent to just require IDs to be lower case
  like many of the other names in the specification, it was deemed unnecessary
  from a technical perspective. Additionally, IDs are often exposed to end
  users as unique identifiers (almost as a "name"), allowing mixed case can
  provider a better user experience.

  Additionally, treating them in a case-insensitive way could lead to
  inconsistencies and frustration for users. If a user purposely used a certain
  casing pattern, but then someone else uses a different pattern for the same
  entity, it is possible that one of those users would end up seeing an
  unexpected casing and could be confused or believe there was an error.

  All of these concerns are avoided by requiring IDs to be stored and compared
  in case insensitively.

# Why the lower character limit on some Group and Resource names?

Attribute names and key names are limited to 63 characters, so why are some
Group and Resource names limited to less? Because when they appear as part of
attribute names and they can be appended with phrases like `url`, `count`
or `base64`, and they still have to fit within the 63-character limit, and so
we need to take into account the length of those phrases.

Note that Resource names are limited to 57 characters because they may be
appended with `base64`, if their `hasdocument` model aspect is `true`.

# Why must Group type and Resource type names be valid attribute names?

Since Group type and Resource type names will appear as attribute names (e.g.
`<GROUPS>count` and `<RESOURCE>url`), the character set (and length) of their
names need to be restricted in the same way as a attribute names.

# Choosing unique Group and Resource names

Aside from choosing names that give some descriptive meaning to the purpose
of these entities, care should be taken when choosing names for entities that
might be imported into other Registries. For example, Group names are often
suffixed (or prefixed) with domain (or company) specific words to avoid
name collisions with other similarly named entities. This might be useful
for Resource names too (if they might co-exist under shared Groups), but
normally ensuring uniqueness at the Group level is sufficient.

# Are `self` and `shortself` attributes static?

In general any URL reference to an entity in the Registry should remain
static for the lifetime of the entity, otherwise anything persisting that
reference will break when it attempts to use it. So, in this sense, yes
these attributes should be static in general. However, the specification
can not mandate this because there may be times when the risk of breaking
existing references becomes necessary.

For example, perhaps a Registry needs to move to a new host, and the old
one is no longer available, even to offer a redirect. Or, if the server
needs to switch to a new "URL shortener" service and so all of the "shortself"
values need to change.

Obviously, situations like these should be rare but the specification needs
to allow for them.

# Why does an unknown query parameter not generate an error?

People have identified cases where query parameters might be added to request
URLs without the client (or developer) having control to prevent it. It might
be client-side tooling or intermediaries (e.g. proxies) that might modify
the URL - for example to add tracking or end-to-end tracing information.

To avoid these clients not being able to interact with an xRegistry deployment,
the authors chose to have the server ignore unknown query parameters. It is
worth noting that the specification says they SHOULD be ignored, not that they
MUST be ignored. So there is room for an implementation to be very picky if
needed, but at the risk of potentially causing interoperability problems.

# Updating attributes with `ifvalues`

The `ifvalues` feature might be a new concept for some readers, so a point
of clarification might be useful. If an attribute is defined with an `ifvalues`
aspect, then if that attribute's value changes it is possible that the
set of sibling attributes that are part of that entity's model could change
due to a new `ifvalues` match (or due to no match at all).

When a client is performing a write operation that changes that attribute's
value, the client must ensure that the net result of the changes are compliant
with the resulting model. Meaning, if that attribute's new value adds or
removes attributes then the client might need to also change other attributes
in the entity in order to be model compliant.

Likewise, implementations of the server must validate the entire entity
against the new model, not just a subset of the entity's attributes.

# Multi-root ancestor hierarchies

The [`ancestor` attribute](spec.md#ancestor-attribute) is used to build a
hierarchy of Versions to facilitate compatibility checking when the
[`compatibility` attribute](spec.md#compatibility-attribute) is set. There
are cases in which it's desirable to create multiple roots. In some
cases it may even be unavoidable, for example when the `maxversions`
attribute (see `groups.resources.maxversions` under
[Resource Model](spec.md#registry-model)) is set to a value that forces
pruning of the Version tree. In such cases, when deleting the oldest Version,
this could result in a new root being created when there are multiple
decedents of the deleted Version.

To signal that a Version represents a root of a hierarchy, the `ancestor`
attribute has its value set to the Version's `versionid` attribute. This
makes the ancestor explicit, and the possible ambiguity of using another
value such as null which, based on the scenario, could mean "no ancestor" or
"default to the newest".

# `singleversionroot` Policy Enforcement

Related to the previous discussions concerning the `ancestor` attribute,
the [Resource Model](spec.md#registry-model) `singleversionroot` attribute
controls whether a Resource is allowed to have more than one "root" Version,
or whether all Versions of that Resource must be a descendant of the same
"root" Version.

Whether `singleversionroot` is `true` or `false` will depend on the use case
in which the Registry is being used. Some examples that might help pick the
most appropriate value include:

- If each major version of a Resource is a significant change, such that to
  that domain's users it could be considered an entirely new Resource (e.g.
  a non-backwards compatible change has been made), then setting
  `singleversionroot` to `true` and using a different xRegistry Resource for
  each major version might be appropriate. Note that this then implies that all
  Versions under each Resources will likely be compatible, and some
  environments have such a policy requirement.

- However, if a new Resource for each major version introduces a concern about
  the proliferation of Resources, and a domain's users are comfortable if
  checking the Versions string for each Version of a Resource as a hint to the
  compatibility of the Versions, then setting `singleversionroot` to `false`
  might be appropriate. Additionally, a value of `false` might make sense if
  the version string is "just another attribute" of the Version and the
  Resource is acting more like a "collection" of Versions rather than an
  enforcer of a semantic versioning policy.

These examples are not meant to be complete. The flexibility of the
specification allows for model authors to choose the most appropriate value
for their needs.

# Pruning Versions with `singleversionroot` enabled

There are cases in which the server will need to prune Versions. For
example, this can happen when attempting to create a new Version that would
exceed the value set on the `groups.resources.maxversions` attribute of the
[Resource Model](spec.md#registry-model), or when adjusting this attribute's
value that is smaller than the number of existing Versions. In such
scenarios, the server may be unable to prune Versions, when the
`groups.resources.singleversionroot` attribute of the
[Resource Model](spec.md#registry-model) is set to `true` and the request
must be rejected.

Consider a scenario in which 3 Versions exist: v1 is the root (and therefore
has its `ancestor` attribute set to v1), and v2 and v3 both have
their `ancestor` attribute set to v1. In addition, the
`groups.resources.maxversions` is set to 3. When creating a new Version, the
server will find the oldest Version (v1) and attempt to prune it. However,
deleting v1 would mean that v2 and v3 would become roots, as both of them
would need to point to themselves. This is exactly the behavior that the
`groups.resources.singleversionroot` attribute prevents when set to `true`.
Therefore, the server is unable to prune Versions and will block the
creation of a new Version. To resolve this, the user will have to manually
delete v2 or v3 to allow the server to prune the oldest Version (v1) before
creating a new Version.

# What's the oldest/newest Version of a Resource?

The oldest Version of a Resource isn't necessarily the one with the oldest
`createdat` timestamp, because the `ancestor` attribute takes precedence
over the `createdat` attribute. This is because the ancestor tree more
accurately describes an ordered lineage of the Versions than timestamps. In
the case multiple Versions exist with the same `createdat` timestamp, those
Versions are sorted in a ascending alphabetical order, and the first is the
oldest Version.

The newest Version of a Resource is selected by searching in the opposite
direction: first identifying all leaves of the hierarchy (i.e. all Versions
that are not used as ancestors for any other Versions), and then finding the
one with the newest `createdat` timestamp. In the case that multiple
Versions exist with the same `createdat` timestamp, those Versions are
sorted in an descending alphabetical order, and the first is the newest
Version.

# What does the `compatibilityauthority` attribute convey?

The [`compatibility` attribute](spec.md#compatibility-attribute) is a
statement made by the authority managing the registry about the
compatibility guarantees between Versions of the Resource. The authority is
expected to guarantee the configured `compatibility`. The
[`compatibilityauthority` attribute](spec.md#compatibilityauthority-attribute)
represents who the enforcing authority is. Any requests to set the authority
to the server when the server cannot perform compatibility checking will be
refused. In cases where the hosting service isn't backed by an xRegistry
implementation (e.g. blob-store), it is recommended that
`compatibilityauthority` is set to `external` to accurately reflect the
situation. However, there may be cases where it is appropriate to set it to
`server`. For example, if the file-server based xRegistry is an alternative
mechanism to retrieve data from another xRegistry service that did validate
the data (i.e. it was exported to the file-server), and there's a desire to
not expose this implementation/deployment choice to the end-user. In other
words, the use of the file-server as a caching service should be transparent
to their users.

# Detecting circular references between Versions

The specification mentions that the Version's `ancestor` attribute should not
be set in such a way as to cause a circular dependency list between Versions.
However, when talking about the server generating an error in such conditions
it says it is "STRONGLY RECOMMENDED" that an error is generated, not that it
"MUST" be generated. This is not meant to be used by implementations as a way
to avoid doing the check in general. However, it is recognized that there
might be situations (such as when the number of Versions is very large) that
performing this check upon every change could become a performance concern.

Rather than mandating a potentially burdensome requirement on implementations,
the specification allows for this check to be skipped if there is no
reasonable way to do it. However, if an implementation chooses not to perform
the check then it becomes incumbent upon them to ensure that there are no
negative ramifications. For example, when performing backwards compatibility
checking, they may need to add extra logic to ensure they don't go caught in
an infinite loop. Additionally, implementations should also document that they
do not enforce this check to set the proper expectation levels for their users.

# Optional required fields in requests

One of the design principles of the specification was to try to make each
object be fully self-describing, within reason. For example, this is why when
objects appear within maps the map key is often replicated within the object
itself. For example, when looking at a Versions collection it might look like
this:

```yaml
"version": {
  "v1": {
    "versionid": "v1",
    ...
  },
  "v2": {
    "versionid": "v2",
    ...
  }
}
```

Notice that the key is duplicated as the `versionid` in each case.

However, when those attributes are defined as "required", that does not
necessarily mean that they are required to appear on all requests if the
server can determine the proper value via some other means, such as the owning
map key, or if the request URL includes the information.

From specification perspective, all that's required is that after any
operation all required fields have valid values. Whether it is provided by
the client or calculated/inferred by the server is an implementation detail.

This accommodation only applies to incoming messages. All server generated
messages (aside from when special flags, like the `?doc` flag, is enabled)
must include all required attributes, even if they are duplicated elsewhere
in the message.

# Deprecation of entities in an xRegistry

The core specification defines a `deprecated` attribute that may appear
under a Resource's `meta` sub-object. This attribute was added to the Resource
itself rather than to the Version because it was determined that the most
likely usage of this feature is to express the intent to deprecate the entire
Resource rather than just one Version (or subset of Versions). This is not say
that the use of this feature might not be useful at the Version-level or even
at the Group-level. However, for those cases, custom models may define
an extension at the appropriate location in the model to meet their needs.
When doing so it is recommended to use the same attribute definition as
defined in the core specification for consistency. It is worth noting that
the Endpoint [specification](../endpoint/spec.md) does exactly this to
indicate when an Endpoint (i.e. a Group) is deprecated.

## The `format` attribute in the Schema spec

The `format` attribute in the Schema spec is required when the
`compatibility` attribute is set to a value other than `none`. This may
appear to be overly restrictive, especially if your Registry implementation
only supports a single format. The reason for making this field required, is
to ease interoperability of registries through export-import functionality.
That means that when exporting a Schema Registry that only supports a single
format, the `format` attribute will already be set, avoiding issues when
importing this Registry into a server that may support multiple formats.

## Problematic characters in attributes

Certain attributes might be used for purposes outside of the scope of the
xRegistry specification. For example, the `name` or ID-values might be used
as a file name. While some care was taken to limit the allowable characters
in some of these cases to the most common uses, not every possible use
could be taken into account. Therefore, in situations where a value's allowable
character set might be problematic (e.g. colon (`:`) in a file name on
Windows), the tooling being used is expected to deal with any potential
problems that might arise. For example, it may choose to convert or escape
problematic characters. The specification makes no statement as to how
these situations are handled, or even if they're supported. In other words,
tooling might reject such cases, or force uses to use non-problematic
characters.

## Why do Resources have 3 levels of data?

Resource attributes are split into 3 categories:

- Resource level
- Resource Meta level
- Resource Version level

which corresponds to the structure of the Resource object. In other words the
Resource, serialized in JSON, appears like this:

```yaml
{
  "<RESOURCE>id": ...,
  # Resource level attributes appear here
  # Additionally the "default" Version's attributes would appear here

  "meta": {
    "<RESOURCE>id": ...,
    # Resource meta level attributes appear here
  }

  "versions": {
    "<KEY>": {
      "<RESOURCE>id": ...,
      "versionid": ...
      # Resource Version level attributes appear here
    }
  }
}
```

"Resource level" attributes consist of two types:
1 - Attributes that makes sense when the Resource is viewed as an alias for
    the default Version of that Resource. So this would include all of the
    default Version's attributes with the exception that any URLs referencing
    the Version (e.g. `self`) would point to the Resource instead.
2 - Attributes to help in the navigation of the Resource structure. This
    includes the "meta" sub-object, the "metaurl" and the "versions"
    collection related attributes.

This allows for clients to interact with the Resource and the Resource's
default Version almost interchangeably. Most notable difference are the extra
attributes from group 2 above.

"Resource Meta" level attributes are attributes that are global, and apply
to the Resource itself and potentially to all Versions of the Resource.
Such as the creation date of the Resource, or whether the Resource and its
Versions are read-only. Ideally, these would be present at the Resource level
but to avoid potential collisions with Version attributes, it was moved into
the "meta" sub-object. Additionally, it's expected that the "meta" level
attribute are not normally the most significant data of the Resource - that
would be the Version attributes - and they will probably not be examined or
changed nearly as often as the Version attributes.

"Resource Version" level attributes, as the name implies, are attributes
that can change on a per-Version basis. These are expected to be the main
reason for the Resource to exist.

The choice of when an attribute appears in the "meta" sub-object versus in the
Version should be driven by whether the use cases being supported by the
Resource type definition requires that attribute to be consistent across all
Versions or have a Version-specific value.

## Why are some (conditional) read-only attributes not ignored?

Attributes that are always defined as "read-only" normally have semantics such
that attempts to update them are silently ignored. This is especially useful
for attributes that might change over time so that clients do not need to
either ensure they have the latest value, or remove them from an update
request.

However, there are times when trying to update a read-only attribute must
generate an error. This will happen when the attribute might be read-only based
on the configuration of the owning entity, in which case it is important for
clients to know that updating this particular instance of this
"sometimes read-only" attribute failed. So, while it may seem inconsistent,
the risk of clients assuming a non-error response meant the request was fully
adhere to was considered more important.

For example, if a Resource is defined with the `setdefaultversionsticky`
aspect set to `false` then the `meta.defaultversionid` attribute of instances
of that Resource becomes "read-only". And any attempt to update it will result
in an error being generated.

## Why isn't `PUT` idempotent?

As stated in the [core](spec.md) specification, the `PUT` operations are
almost idempotent, per the HTTP specification. For the most part, multiple
similar `PUT` requests will have the same effect as a single one, with the
exception that `epoch` and `modifiedat` will be updated each time. This is
due to the desire to avoid having server implementations perform a "diff" type
of check on all attributes to determine if anything changed, and then only
"bumping" those attributes' values if there was a change. This could be an
expensive or ambiguous check to perform, so it was determined it would be best
to avoid it all together.
